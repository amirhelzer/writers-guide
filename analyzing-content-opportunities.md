# Analyzing Content Opportunities

As a writer, it’s part of your responsibility to verify that the content you’re about to write has a good chance of succeeding. Don’t assume that any content idea that you raise or you receive is thoroughly evaluated and is ready for writing.

You need to check and see that:

* There’s unmet demand for this content  
* There’s available for you a realistic funnel to drive traffic to this content  
* You’re able to produce this content in high quality and on time

### Unmet demand for your content

We always want to produce content that many people need and is not available. Here are some cases showing demand and supply.

| Demand | Supply | Vertict |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| People need to know about a new release of your software (certain demand). | There’s no announcement blog post for it (no supply). | Write the announcement blog post. |
| People need to know your terms and conditions (certain demand). | There’s already a page that describes the terms and conditions (available supply). | Don’t write additional documentation for the terms and conditions. |
| People are searching for how to do SEO (a lot of demand). | There are many blog posts and tutorials on how to do SEO (a lot of supply). | Don’t write another tutorial on SEO. |
| People need to know how to operate software X for purpose Y (solid demand). | There are only a few, outdated and incomplete tutorials on the topics (poor supply). | Write your own tutorial on operating software X for purpose Y. |

If you look at search results and see many high-quality guides from authoritative sites, you can't compete by 'trying harder.' Find a different angle or don't write it.

Bottom line, just “demand” (search traffic) is not enough. Don’t go into a content project if you can’t compete with the current “supply” (existing content).

### A realistic funnel to drive traffic to your content

Once you’ve established that there’s enough interest in your content and not too much competition, check that you can actually drive traffic to it. Sometimes, driving traffic is almost trivial. You’re writing to your clients and can email them to let them know about your new content.

A traffic funnel isn’t always as straight forward as sending a newsletter to your clients.

If you’re planning on SEO for your traffic, see that your domain has enough authority and is on a relevant topic. Your traffic funnel might be based on affiliates, partners and other arrangements. They’re all fine, as long as you analyze them realistically, not applying wishful thinking.

### You’re able to produce this content well and on time

I wouldn’t be able to produce high quality content about life on planet Pluto. I’m not an expert on the topic and I can’t try it myself. Before you commit to producing content, make sure you have the resources to do so, on time. There’s no project with an infinite schedule. Someone is always waiting for your content and there’s always a list of other projects waiting for you.

If the schedule to complete the content isn’t clear to you, ask. If the amount of time you can spend writing this content isn’t clear to you, ask. When you know the parameters, check that the writing project is realistic.
