# We’re busy. Be concise.

### Default to concise

Readers decide fast. Research consistently shows that shorter content performs better:

#### 1\) [Boomerang: 40M emails](https://blog.boomerangapp.com/2016/02/7-tips-for-getting-more-responses-to-your-emails-with-data/) (2016)

Based on 40+ million emails, the “sweet spot” for email length is 50–125 words, with response rates above 50% in that range; response rates decline as emails get longer (e.g., \~44% around 500 words), and very short emails also underperform. This blog post is from 2016 and quotes email stats which you probably cannot replicate today, but the trend remains.

#### 2\) [Nielsen Norman Group: controlled usability experiment](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/) (1997)

In a study using five versions of the same site (same info, different writing), the concise version (about half the word count) had 58% higher measured usability; “scannable” was \+47%, and combining improvements was \+124%.

### What “concise” actually means

Concise does not mean short.

It means:  
“As short as possible, but not shorter than what the reader needs.”

Removing words that don’t change understanding is concision.  
Removing words that carry meaning is oversimplification.

A simple test:

* If deleting a sentence doesn’t change the decision the reader will make, delete it.  
* If it does, keep it — even if the text gets longer.

### How to write concisely (in practice)

Edit with intent:

* One idea per paragraph.  
* Delete explanations of the obvious.  
* Replace phrases with single words.  
  * “In order to” → “to”  
  * “At this point in time” → “now”  
* Remove warm-ups. Start where value starts.  
* Cut 20–30% after writing. Then reread for clarity.

If clarity survives, the cut was correct.

### When the long version is the right choice

Some topics are naturally complex. They require longer explanations to be understood correctly.

If you’re explaining:

* A complicated concept  
* A non-obvious workflow  
* A system with many moving parts

Then your job is not to shorten. It’s to explain well. A complete explanation is still concise. It’s long, because the topic requires a long explanation, but concisely.

However, there’s an important signal here:  
If explaining your own product requires long, careful instructions, you’ve likely found a usability problem.

When that happens:

* Don’t “solve” it with more documentation.  
* Find the right person (designer, product owner, developer).  
* Explain where users get confused.  
* Push to simplify the product.

Documentation should clarify reality, not compensate for complexity.

Long explanations are acceptable when complexity is unavoidable or as a temporary solution, while your company is simplifying a too-complicated product.

They are a warning sign for complexity that needs to be handled.

In your practice assignment, you'll take successful long-form content and cut it substantially while preserving its core value. This will develop your ability to identify what's essential versus what's padding.
